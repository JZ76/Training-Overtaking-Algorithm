# [DISSERTATION] Training-Overtaking-Algorithm


> This repository is the second part of my dissertation ***"[F1TENTH](https://f1tenth.org/index.html): Development of A Multi-Agent Simulator and An Overtaking Algorithm Using Machine Learning"***  

Please feel free to raise topics in Issues section, I will try my best to answer them!

car_state_blue_XXXX or car_state_red_XXXX  

> Sidenote: vehicle model is bicycle model with dynamic equations.  
> blue car is the car perform overtaking behaviour, aka ego vehicle.  
> red car is the leading vehicle.

> Speed and steering angle are the driving command, the real speed and steer angle are not the same as driving command  
> the vehicle model determines the mapping between driving command and real value
